       - a number of milliseconds, which is the maximum time that the invocation will block
         before returning the next response message.  If the timeout is exceeded, nil
         is returned.  Multiple response messages are expected for each sent request; a
         response message with a :status of \"done\" indicates that the associated request
         has been fully processed, and that no further response messages should be expected.
         See response-seq and combine-responses for some utilities for consuming message
         responses.
       - the :interrupt keyword. This sends an interrupt message for the request
         associated with the response function, and blocks for default-timeout milliseconds
         for confirmation of the interrupt.
   
   The 0-arg response function arity is the same as invoking (receive-fn default-timeout)."

;; TODO
;; - core
;;   - proper error handling on the receive loop
;;   - make write-response a send-off to avoid blocking in the REP loop.
;;   - bind out-of-band message options for evaluated code to access?
;; - tools
;;   - add ClojureQL-style quasiquoting to in-repl
;; - streams
;;   - what to do about *out* / *err* in futures, agent sends, etc?
;;   - optionally multiplex System/out and System/err
;;   - optionally join multiplexed S/out and S/err, receive :stdout, :stderr msgs
;; - protocols and transport
;;   - dependency-free websockets adapter (should be able to run on the same port!)
;;   - STOMP when dep-free client and broker impls are available
;; - cmdline
;;   - support for connecting to a server
;;   - optionally running other clojure script(s)/java mains prior to starting/connecting to a server
