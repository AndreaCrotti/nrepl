= Overview

nREPL is a Clojure network REPL that provides a REPL server and
client, along with some common APIs of use to IDEs and other tools
that may need to evaluate Clojure code in remote environments.

== Why nREPL?

nREPL has been designed with the aim of ensuring that it satisfies the
requirements of both application developers (in support of activities ranging
from interactive remote debugging and experimentation in development
contexts through to more advanced use cases such as updating deployed
applications) as well as toolmakers (providing a standard way to connect to and
introspect running environments as a way of informing user interfaces of all
kinds, including "standard" interactive, text-based REPLs).

The default network protocol used is simple, depending neither
on JVM or Clojure specifics, thereby allowing (encouraging?) the development
of non-Clojure REPL clients.  The REPLs operational semantics are such
that essentially any non-JVM Clojure implementation should be able to
implement it, with allowances for hosts that lack the concurrency primitives to
support e.g. asynchronous evaluation, interrupts, etc.

For more information about the motivation, architecture, use cases, and
discussion related to nREPL, see the original design notes,

around its recent redesign.footnote:[It's not that recent anymore, as the
redesign happened in 2012. It marked the beginning of the long-lived nREPL 0.2 series.]

== Status

Despite its modest version number, nREPL is extremely stable at this
point. Its communication protocol and API are rock-solid and battle
tested and have been powering much of the existing Clojure tooling for
several years now.footnote:[nREPL had virtually no alternatives before
the introduction of the built-in Socket REPL in Clojure 1.8.]

Given the massive community investment in developing all sorts of
tooling on top of nREPL, nREPL's team pledges to evolve the project only in
a responsible manner and backwards-compatible ways.

NOTE: The migration of nREPL out of Clojure Contrib is probably the
only case where we were forced to make breaking changes.footnote:[Apart
from removing deprecated code that is.] Those are detailed in great
detail <<installation.adoc#upgrading,here>>.
