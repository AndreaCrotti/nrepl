= Transports

 talk about strings vs. bytestrings, the encoding thereof, etc when we

_Transports_ are roughly analogous to Ring's adapters: they provide an
implementation of a common protocol (`nrepl.transport.Transport`)
to enable nREPL clients and servers to send and receive messages without regard
for the underlying channel or particulars of message encoding.

nREPL includes two transports, both of which are socket-based: a "tty"
transport that allows one to connect to an nREPL endpoint using e.g. `telnet`
(which therefore supports only the most simplistic interactive evaluation of
expressions), and one that uses

nREPL messages over sockets.  It is the latter that is used by default by
`nrepl.server/start-server` and `nrepl.core/connect`.
