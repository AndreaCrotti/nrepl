## There and Back Again

nREPL has had an unusual history, which seems worthwhile documenting here.

nREPL started as a personal project of mine @ https://github.com/cemerick/nREPL
in 2010. After an initial period of interest from various downstream tool
authors, it was invited to be one of the initial three projects in the "new"
Clojure Contrib family of projects later that year, and thus moved to
https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl.

nREPL grew and stabilized under the Contrib umbrella for years. Various
collaboration and process challenges, differences of opinion, and changing work
priorities eventually led to work on nREPL slowing significantly, to the
frustration of its most active users.

Eventually, I proposed migrating nREPL out of Clojure Contrib in the summer of
2017 (https://github.com/cemerick/nREPL/issues/1), with the objective of
reconstituting an environment where the people most interested in and impacted
by nREPL could participate in its development as easily as possible.

## To Infinity and Beyond

In the spring of 2018 Chas decided to hand over the development of
nREPL to the team behind CIDER and the efforts to build awesome
Clojure dev tools powered by editor-independent nREPL middleware
(e.g. `cider-nrepl`, `refactor-nrepl`, `piggieback`), therefore the
current "home" address of nREPL. We're really excited to advance nREPL
forward and to build many sweet REPLs on top of it!

Looking forward to seeing you around! We need all the help we can get!

Cheers,<br/>
